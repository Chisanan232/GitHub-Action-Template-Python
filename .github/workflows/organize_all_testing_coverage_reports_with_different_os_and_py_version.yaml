# Workflow Description:
#     Organize all the testing coverage reports. (it would save reports by 'actions/upload-artifact@v3').
#
# Workflow input parameters:
#     * test_type: The testing type. In generally, it only has 2 options: 'unit-test' and 'integration-test'.
#     * generate_xml_report_finally: Something, it only has 1 test type currently. So it could let this option
#        to be 'true' than it would generate XML report finally to let uploading process to use it directly.
#
# Workflow running output:
#     No, but it would save the testing coverage reports (coverage.xml) to provide after-process to organize and record.
