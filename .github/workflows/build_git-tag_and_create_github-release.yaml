# Workflow Description:
#     Build a git tag on a specific commit in every git branch. And create GitHub release if current git branch is 'master'.
#
# Workflow input parameters:
#     * General arguments:
#         * project_type: Different project type would get the software version info in different way.
#         * activate_git_event: Which git event should activate the workflow.
#         * debug_mode: It would run the tasks as log message, doesn't essentially run feature if this option is true.
#
# Workflow running output:
#     Yes, it has running result output. The output is the release version.
